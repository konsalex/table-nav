Inspo from AGGrid:

1. Enter will get you inside the first focusable element inside the cell if any (this is only for the header, not the body)
2. Enter will get you to the cell below if you are in a body cell
3. Space in header does nothing
4. Space in cells triggers a click in clickable elements (checkboxes, buttons, etc)
5. CMD+C in cell copies the text in the cell, but this is not mine?!

Also GRID by ARIA specs:

### Cell Navigation

> **Note**
> WTF (What the focus) is going on. There is no standardised way to know what is actually focusable in the web.
> To comply with this lib and work properly, you need to add a `tabindex` attribute explicitly to the elements you want to be focusable, inside a cell, except for `input` and `textarea` elements.

> The below keystrokes are supported natively by browsers, so this library will not implement any handling

- Tab: moves focus to the next widget in the grid. Optionally, the focus movement may wrap inside a single cell or within the grid itself. (As described, there should be no trap focus inside a grid cell).
- Shift + Tab: moves focus to the previous widget in the grid. Optionally, the focus movement may wrap inside a single cell or within the grid itself.

### TODO

- [x] : Fix header not working
- [x] : Add Needle table example
- [ ] : Add tests
- [ ] : Fix filtering not working
- [x] : Create cool logo and keyboard keys
- [ ] : Add docs
- [ ] : Add individual hooks to handle granular actions, and leave a generic table hook to handle simple tables. Like `widgetKeydown`?
- [ ] : Add framework wrappers, for react for example

<h2 align="center" style="margin-top:-20px">table-nav</h2>

**table-nav is a headless utility library, that enables accessible keyboard navigation of data grids (aka tables).**


The ARIA specs for data grid navigation can be found here:

<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/grid/"><img src="./assets/w3c.png" height="auto" width="80"></a>

**table-nav** consists of:
* `core`: Contains all the logic of the library, which is framework-agnostic
* `react`: Useful wrappers to work with React projects
* `svelte` (soon): Useful wrappers to work with Svelte projects


### Installation

```bash
yarn add @table-nav/core @table-nav/react
```

### Usage

### Cell Navigation

> **Note**
> WTF (What the focus) is going on. There is no standardised way to know what is actually focusable in the web.
> To comply with this lib and work properly, you need to add a `tabindex` attribute explicitly to the elements you want to be focusable, inside a cell, except for `input` and `textarea` elements.

> The below keystrokes are supported natively by browsers, so they are not implement

- `Tab`: moves focus to the next widget in the grid. Optionally, the focus movement may wrap inside a single cell or within the grid itself. (As described, there should be no trap focus inside a grid cell).
- `Shift + Tab`: moves focus to the previous widget in the grid. Optionally, the focus movement may wrap inside a single cell or within the grid itself.

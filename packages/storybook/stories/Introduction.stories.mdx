<h2 className="font-semibold">Welcome to <b>table-nav</b></h2>

This Storybook will serve as an example on how you can turn your tables, or data-grids, keyboard navigable with just a few lines of code.

This library is currently <b>v0</b>, and things may change, but looking forward for your feedback, so we can shape this to something helpful for more devs, and enrich accessibility and usability in our tables.

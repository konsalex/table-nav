**table-nav is a headless utility library, that enables accessible keyboard navigation of data grids (aka tables).**

The ARIA specs for data grid navigation can be found here:

**table-nav** consists of:
* `core`: Contains all the logic of the library, which is framework-agnostic
* `react`: Useful wrappers to work with React projects
* `svelte` (soon): Useful wrappers to work with Svelte projects. [Example link](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/interesting-cdn-7krjys?embed=1&file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.svelte%3A140%2C20)


### Installation

```bash
yarn add @table-nav/core @table-nav/react
```

### Usage

To use this library you can either use directly the `core` package or the `react` package.

#### Core

Below is an example on how you can use the `core` package in a simple HTML table.
This package is framework-agnostic, and you can find an example integration with [Svelte here](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/interesting-cdn-7krjys?embed=1&file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.svelte%3A132%2C31-132%2C43).

```js
// DataGridNav is the main class of the library
import { DataGridNav } from "@table-nav/core";

// Create a new instance of the class
const dataGridNav = new DataGridNav({
  // Library is written in TS and all the options will be recommended inside your IDE
  debug: true,
});

// Use the function provided by the library to handle the keydown/up events
table.addEventListener("keydown", dataGridNav.tableKeyDown);
table.addEventListener("keyup", dataGridNav.tableKeyUp); // This is neccessery to allow more than 1 key shortcuts
```

#### React

For projects using react, `@table-nav/react` provides a useful hook to work with.


```jsx
// Import hook from "@table-nav/react"
import { useTableNav } from '@table-nav/react';

// Inside your HOC component
const { tableNav, listeners } = useTableNav();

<YourTable {...listeners} />
```

`useTableNav` returns an object with 2 properties:
* `tableNav`: An instance of the `DataGridNav` class. Useful for programmatic navigation, and enabling/disabling the functionality for use-cases, like widget focus inside cell.
* `listeners`: An object with the `onKeyDown` and `onKeyUp` listeners, that you can spread inside your table element.

All the examples inside [`packages/storybook`](https://github.com/konsalex/table-nav/tree/main/packages/storybook/stories) are with `@table-nav/react`, so feel free to take a look how they work.

### Cell Navigation

> **Note**
> WTF (What the focus) is going on. There is no standardised way to know what is actually focusable in the web.
> To comply with this lib and work properly, you need to add a `tabindex` attribute explicitly to the elements you want to be focusable, inside a cell, except for `input` and `textarea` elements.

> The below keystrokes are supported natively by browsers, so they are not implement

- `Tab`: moves focus to the next widget in the grid. Optionally, the focus movement may wrap inside a single cell or within the grid itself. (As described, there should be no trap focus inside a grid cell).
- `Shift + Tab`: moves focus to the previous widget in the grid. Optionally, the focus movement may wrap inside a single cell or within the grid itself.
